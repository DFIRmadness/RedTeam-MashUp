# RedTeam-MashUp
Notes were originally created in mid 2017.  However after a major overhaul a new Repo was created.

### These notes are Red Team focused.  They are centered around PWK style hacking techniques
PWK Style:  Going beyond simply throwing metasploit at it.

The Intent is to use this as a quick guide to cut and paste commands.  Certain variables are expected to be exported in the Linux CLI.  Example $tgt and $me etc.

Eventually this will break into to seperate files's with OSCP Focued, PenTesting Focused and Red Team Focused Pastables and CheckLists.

#### Current work:
Currently I am over hauling this to go in order from Recon to Post-Pillaging.  I am also working on breaking it down to by port.
The next phase will be to convert it all to Markdown to make it cleaner.
