# RedTeam-MashUp
Notes were originally created in mid 2017.  However after a major overhaul a new Repo was created.
OSCP Focused Lab Pastable with some general Red Teaming Pastables.
The Intent is to use this as a quick guide to cut and paste commands.  Certain variables are expected to be exported in the Linux CLI.  Example $tgt and $me etc.
Eventually this will break into to seperate Repo's with OSCP Focued, PenTesting Focused and Red Team Focused Pastables and CheckLists.
